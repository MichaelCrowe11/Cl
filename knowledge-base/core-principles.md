# CroweOS Systems Knowledge Base - Core Principles

## The Four Pillars Framework

Build the app around four pillars—**Monitor → Decide → Act → Learn**—so growers always know what's happening in their farm, what it means, what to do next, and how to do it better next time.

### Pillar 1: Monitor
**Grower pain solved:** "I don't see problems until caps deform."
- Real-time sensor data collection
- Visual health indicators
- Proactive alert systems

### Pillar 2: Decide
**Grower pain solved:** "I'm not sure what's off when yield dips."
- AI-powered analysis
- Decision trees and logic
- Predictive insights

### Pillar 3: Act
**Grower pain solved:** "Where's the right SOP?"
- Actionable recommendations
- Standard operating procedures
- Automated task management

### Pillar 4: Learn
**Grower pain solved:** "Did last tweak help?"
- Batch tracking and analysis
- Performance metrics
- Continuous improvement

## Target Audience
From garage rack operations to 1-acre warehouse facilities - giving every farm the tools to see sooner, react faster, and improve every cycle.
