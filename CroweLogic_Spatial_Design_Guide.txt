Title: Mushroom Cultivation Facility Spatial Logic Guide

Overview:
This document defines the core spatial layout and operational flow of a high-performance mushroom cultivation facility. It is designed for use by Crowe Logic's architectural reasoning module.

Zone Definitions:
- Substrate Prep: Requires proximity to water, drainage, and thermal-tolerant materials.
- Sterilization Area: Houses autoclaves or steam sterilizers; must be isolated and ventilated.
- Lab (Clean Room): Positive pressure, HEPA filtered, sealed with antechamber entry.
- Incubation: Low light, stable temperature (~75°F), low airflow, medium humidity.
- Fruiting Chambers: High humidity (85–95%), high airflow, CO2 scrubbing, misting/humidity automation.
- Cold Storage: Insulated space for harvested product; ideally near loading area.
- Waste/Compost: Downwind, isolated; includes spent block storage and compost bins.
- Office/Utility: Workspace and facility controls.

Flow Logic:
1. Raw Materials > Substrate Prep > Sterilization
2. Sterile Substrate > Lab > Incubation
3. Colonized Substrate > Fruiting
4. Harvested Mushrooms > Cold Storage
5. Spent Substrate > Waste/Compost

Design Principles:
- Maintain clean-to-dirty airflow direction
- Minimize cross-contamination by zoning
- Use washable, mold-resistant surfaces in humid areas

Facility Sizing:
Rule of Thumb: 2.0–2.5 sq ft per pound of weekly mushroom output
Example: 2000 lbs/week = ~4000–5000 sq ft
