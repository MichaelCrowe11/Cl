### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made
- [x] Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind
- [x] AI: OpenAI + Anthropic APIs
- [x] Vector DB: Supabase Vector (pgvector) for MVP
- [x] Event Bus: Redis/Upstash for real-time features
- [x] Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Vector extensions
- [x] Infrastructure: Vercel + Supabase + CDN

## Week 2: Security & Compliance

### 🔒 Security Threat Model ✅
- [x] FDA/Bioethics compliance checklist ✅ (Comprehensive regulatory framework with automated assessment)
- [x] Data privacy impact assessment ✅ (GDPR compliance system with user rights management)
- [x] Bias detection framework (EEG²) ✅ (Real-time bias analysis with safety violations detection)
- [x] Safe-degradation failsafes ✅ (Integrated into bias detection engine)

### 📋 Compliance Framework ✅
- [x] ISO 27001 security controls ✅ (Full ISMS implementation with 14 control categories)
- [x] GDPR consent mechanisms ✅ (Complete consent management with data subject rights)
- [x] Biosafety advisory validation ✅ (Integrated into FDA compliance framework)
- [x] Open-source license audit (SBOM) ✅ (Part of security controls)

## Week 3-4: Foundation Infrastructure

### 🛠️ Core Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Production environment provisioning
- [x] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Monitoring & observability (Sentry + PostHog)
- [x] Database schema design
