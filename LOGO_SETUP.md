# Crowe Logic AI Logo Setup

## Official Logo Implementation

The official Crowe Logic AI logo has been provided and needs to be saved as `/public/crowe-avatar.png`.

### Logo Characteristics:
- **Style**: Stylized portrait with artistic rendering
- **Primary Color**: Deep purple/violet background
- **Border**: Gold/bronze circular border
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Save the Logo**:
   - Save the provided logo image as `crowe-avatar.png` in the `/public` directory
   - Ensure the image maintains its circular format with the gold border

2. **Logo Usage**:
   The logo is already integrated throughout the platform:
   - Header avatar with gold ring accent
   - Chat message avatars
   - Loading states
   - Fallback displays "CL" in purple when image fails to load

3. **Color Scheme Updated**:
   - Primary: Purple (`270 50% 40%`)
   - Secondary/Accent: Gold (`45 65% 52%`)
   - Matches the logo's aesthetic

### Current Implementation:

```tsx
// Avatar with official branding
<Avatar className="h-10 w-10 ring-2 ring-yellow-600/50">
  <AvatarImage src="/crowe-avatar.png" alt="Crowe Logic AI" className="object-cover" />
  <AvatarFallback className="bg-purple-600 text-white font-bold">CL</AvatarFallback>
</Avatar>
```

### Design Consistency:
- All avatars use consistent purple/gold theming
- Gold ring accent on AI avatars
- Purple fallback background
- Clean, professional appearance matching the official brand

The platform is now fully branded with the Crowe Logic AI identity!
