# Standard Operating Procedure - Batch #001
# Oyster Mushroom Cultivation Protocol
# Crowe Logic Mycology Research Platform

## Overview
This SOP outlines the standard procedure for cultivating oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) in controlled environmental conditions.

## Materials Required
- Sterilized straw substrate (5kg)
- Oyster mushroom spawn (500g)
- Plastic growing bags
- Temperature control system
- Humidity control system
- pH testing kit

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Substrate Preparation
1. Steam sterilize straw at 121°C for 60 minutes
2. Cool substrate to room temperature
3. Test moisture content (target: 60-65%)
4. Adjust pH to 6.0-7.0 if necessary

### Phase 2: Inoculation
1. Mix spawn with substrate in sterile environment
2. Achieve 10% spawn rate (spawn:substrate ratio)
3. Fill growing bags with inoculated substrate
4. Seal bags and label with batch information

### Phase 3: Incubation
- Temperature: 20-24°C
- Humidity: 85-95%
- Duration: 10-14 days
- No light required

### Phase 4: Fruiting
- Temperature: 18-22°C
- Humidity: 80-90%
- Light cycle: 12h on/12h off
- Fresh air exchange: 4-6 times per hour

## Quality Control
- Monitor temperature/humidity every 6 hours
- Check for contamination daily
- Document growth progress with photos
- Record harvest weights

## Expected Outcomes
- First flush: 14-21 days post-inoculation
- Yield: 15-25% of substrate weight
- Multiple flushes possible (2-4 cycles)

## Safety Notes
- Maintain sterile conditions during inoculation
- Use PPE (gloves, mask) when handling materials
- Dispose of contaminated materials properly
