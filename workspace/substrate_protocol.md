# Substrate Preparation Protocol

## Crowe Logic AI Mycology Lab - Standard Operating Procedure

### Overview
This protocol outlines the standard procedure for preparing mushroom cultivation substrates with optimal nutritional content and contamination prevention.

### Materials Required
- Base substrate materials (straw, sawdust, etc.)
- Nutritional supplements (bran, lime, gypsum)
- Water
- pH testing strips
- Sterilization equipment
- Personal protective equipment

### Procedure

#### 1. Material Preparation
- Chop straw to 2-5cm lengths
- Screen sawdust for uniform particle size
- Weigh all components according to recipe

#### 2. Mixing
- Combine dry ingredients first
- Add water gradually while mixing
- Target moisture content: 60-65%
- Check pH: should be 6.0-7.5

#### 3. Sterilization
- Pack substrate in autoclave bags
- Sterilize at 121Â°C for 90-120 minutes
- Allow natural cooling to room temperature

#### 4. Quality Control
- Check for complete sterilization
- Verify moisture content
- Document batch information

### Safety Notes
- Always wear protective equipment
- Ensure proper ventilation
- Follow contamination prevention protocols

### Record Keeping
- Document all measurements
- Record sterilization times and temperatures
- Note any deviations from protocol
