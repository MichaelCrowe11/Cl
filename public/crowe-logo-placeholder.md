# Crowe Logic Logo Placeholder

This file represents the Crowe Logic logo. In a real deployment, this would be replaced with the actual logo image file.

For now, the interface will gracefully handle the missing image and show the gradient background as a fallback.

The logo should be:
- 32x32 pixels for header
- 24x24 pixels for chat tab
- Professional portrait style
- Circular format
- High quality for crisp display
