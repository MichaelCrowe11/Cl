```javascript
// React 19 Actions for lab data updates
function LabDataForm() {
  const [state, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
    async (previousState, formData) => {
      const result = await updateLabData(formData);
      return result;
    },
    null
  );

  return (
    <form action={submitAction}>
      <input name="sampleId" />
      <button disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? 'Updating...' : 'Update'}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

  production: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_PROD,
  staging: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_STAGING
};

// Usage monitoring
const logAPIUsage = (model, tokens, cost) => {
  analytics.track('ai_usage', {
    model,
    tokens,
    cost,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
